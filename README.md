**Methods, Tools & Technical Skills**

- **Genome Quality Control**: FastQC, QUAST  
- **Annotation & Data Parsing**: Prokka, Python (Pandas), Bash scripting  
- **PPI Network Construction**: STRING database  
- **Network Analysis & Hub Gene Detection**: Cytoscape, cytoHubba  
- **File Handling & Visualization**: Excel/TSV, Matplotlib, Cytoscape



**Future Directions**

This work lays the foundation for downstream analyses such as druggability prediction, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations of shortlisted target proteins. Future efforts will also involve comparative genomic analysis with other *Klebsiella* sequence types to identify clone-specific vulnerabilities and assess the evolutionary conservation of these hub genes. Ultimately, the goal is to transition from in silico discovery to wet-lab validation, guiding the development of novel therapeutics against MDR *K. pneumoniae* ST307.
