Gene,Name,Function
prsA,Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase,"Involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis; catalyzes PRPP formation, a key step in nucleotide metabolism"
metG,Methionyl-tRNA synthetase,Essential for protein synthesis; charges tRNA with methionine
arcB,Aerobic respiration control sensor kinase,Part of the ArcA/ArcB two-component system regulating respiratory gene expression under anaerobic conditions
pheT,Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain,Charges tRNA with phenylalanine; essential in translation
aas,Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase,Plays a role in translation by attaching aspartate to its corresponding tRNA
hfIB10,Heat shock protein HflC/HflK family,Regulates proteolysis and stabilizes membrane proteins under stress conditions
smpB,Small protein B,Essential for tmRNA function in trans-translation during ribosome stalling
yfiA,Translation inhibition factor,Protects ribosomes during stress by binding to 70S ribosomes and halting translation
guaA,GMP synthase,"Involved in purine nucleotide biosynthesis, catalyzing GMP formation"
yihl,Hypothetical protein YihL,Putative uncharacterized protein; possible role in stress or transport (functional characterization pending)
yfcX,Uncharacterized conserved protein,Predicted involvement in biofilm or fimbriae regulation; limited functional annotation
